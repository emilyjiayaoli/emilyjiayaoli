ğŸ‘‹ hii im emily!

- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in deep neural nets, computer vision, transformers, LLMs and generative models
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to build and train deep neural nets from scratch (and w pytorch)

Some things I have worked on/am working on:
- Evolution Devices Machine Learning Intern
- ğŸ§¡[ARQuest SSERN](https://www.arquestssern.org/) Founder and Executive Director
- ğŸ”¬Computer Vision Researcher @ Clemson University
- ARQuest research internship project mentor


want to get better at:
- train neural nets and understand inner workings of model transformers
- web dev (react and flask) especially backend and databases
- learn systems design
